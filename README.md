# 🛡️ Spring Boot 2 OAuth 2.0 & Service Discovery Demo 🚀

This repository showcases the implementation of advanced concepts like service discovery and OAuth 2.0 using Java 13 and Spring Boot 2 (specifically, version 2.7.18).  While newer Spring Boot versions offer excellent OAuth 2 support, this demo focuses on a working solution for those stuck with Spring Boot 2 and Java 13 (or 11).

**Disclaimer:** This isn't meant to be the *absolute best* implementation.  It's a practical example to get you started. If you find a better way, awesome! This repo is primarily for illustrative purposes.  Think of it as a helpful starting point, not a production-ready masterpiece. 😉

Projects here were initially scaffolded with [Bootify](https://bootify.io/), a fantastic code generation tool that's worth every penny. Seriously, it's a game-changer for CRUD operations and project scaffolding (like a Ruby on Rails for Java).  If you're building serious applications, consider subscribing to their service for production-grade code generation.

## 🗂️ Projects/Modules

*   **Auctoritas:** The authentication/authorization service. It includes a basic UI and a REST API for token creation, primary key exposure, and token validation. This is the core component for OAuth 2.0. 🔑
*   **Matzati:** A Netflix Eureka server implementation. Eureka is a popular open-source service registration and discovery library.  Big shoutout to Netflix for creating such a useful tool! 🎬
*   **Tabellarius:** A simple service for sending emails and maintaining audit trails.  It exposes a REST API and a basic UI, both secured with OAuth 2.0. ✉️
*   **Tesserarius:** A very basic demo of how to use a token generated by Auctoritas to connect to another service (Tabellarius in this case). 🔗
*   **Commons-Security:** Shared code used by OAuth 2.0 clients. This avoids code duplication across microservices. ⚙️
*   **Commons-Web:** Shared code for creating basic web UIs (generated with Bootify and then customized). 🌐

## 🤔 FAQ

1.  **Why Latin and Hebrew names for the projects?**  Because they sound cool and help avoid naming collisions. Plus, it's a fun way to add a bit of personality! 😎
2.  **Are these the best implementations out there?** Nope, and that's okay! They're examples, not production-ready code.  Treat them as such. 🤷
3.  **Do you accept contributions?**  No. Feel free to fork the repo and make it your own! 🚀
4.  **Why are there unit tests in a demo project?** Because writing tests is a good habit, even for demos.  In real projects, I aim for at least 80% coverage for important code (POJOs and config stuff are usually excluded).  No one likes buggy code! 🐞
5.  **I found an issue. How can I report it?** You can technically report it, but I probably won't respond.  The best way to handle it is to fork the repo and fix it yourself.  Consider it a learning opportunity! 🤓
