# üõ°Ô∏è Commons Security Library

This library provides common OAuth 2.0-related code for both client and resource servers. It simplifies OAuth 2.0 integration by offering reusable components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### `CustomAuthenticationProvider`

A custom authentication provider that interacts with an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server to authenticate users. It retrieves a token based on username and password, parses it, and loads authorities (roles/entitlements) into an `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` object. This is useful for implementing login pages that delegate authentication to an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. üîë
  
### `JwtAuthenticationFilter`

A Spring MVC filter designed for REST APIs. It intercepts requests, looks for an "Authorization" header starting with "Bearer " (indicating a JWT token), validates the token, and extracts claims like username and authorities. ‚öôÔ∏è

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage

If this library is available in your company's JFrog Artifactory, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ludo.mentis.aciem</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-security</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Otherwise, navigate to this directory in your terminal and run `mvn install` to compile and install it in your local Maven repository.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This library contains classes annotated with `@Component` (or derived annotations).  Configure component scanning in your Spring configuration to ensure Spring recognizes these components. Example:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScans(value = {
    @ComponentScan("ludo.mentis.aciem.tabellarius"), // Example: Scanning your package
    @ComponentScan("ludo.mentis.aciem.commons.security") // Example: Scanning this library's package
})
public class AppConfig {
    // ... your configuration ...
}
```

### üîó OpenFeign Integration

This library uses OpenFeign to communicate with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (e.g., "Auctoritas").  Add this library's package to the list of base packages scanned by OpenFeign.  Example:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableFeignClients(basePackages = {
    "ludo.mentis.aciem.tesserarius.client", // In case your project also uses OpenFeign directly
    "ludo.mentis.aciem.commons.security.client" // OpenFeign clients in this library
})
public class AppConfig {
    // ... your configuration ...
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

*   **Spring Cloud Version:** Ensure your application uses the same Spring Cloud version as this library to avoid compatibility issues.
*   **Spring Boot Version:** Use the same Spring Boot version as this library to maintain compatibility.
